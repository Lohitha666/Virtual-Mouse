# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Virtual Mouse** is an AI-powered application that allows users to control their computer mouse using **hand gestures**. Utilizing **computer vision and OpenCV**, it detects hand movements via a webcam and translates them into mouse actions like clicking, scrolling, and dragging.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Follow the steps below to download, set up, and run the project on your local machine.  

# 1️⃣ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- OpenCV for image processing  
- Mediapipe for hand tracking  
- PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse movements  
- NumPy for mathematical operations  

# 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
